# JavaNeoBank

This project is a simple console-based simulation of a NeoBank implemented in Java, designed to provide essential online banking features without physical branches

This is my first project using OOP concepts in Java. The program features interactive menus and allows users to manage accounts, perform transfers, and handle support requests with robust error handling.

## Features
- User roles; regular customers and support staff
- Customer registration, login, and identity verification  
- Account management: balance check, recharge, transaction history  
- Contacts management for easy transfers  
- Support staff functions for verification and request handling  
- Interactive and user-friendly console interface
